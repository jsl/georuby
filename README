=GeoRuby
This is GeoRuby 0.0.2. It is intended as a holder for data returned from PostGIS queries. Therefore, the data model roughly follows the OGC "Simple Features for SQL" specification (see http://www.opengis.org/docs/99-049.pdf), although without any kind of advanced functionalities (such as geometric operators or reprojections).

===Available data types
The following geometric data types are provided :
- Point
- Line string
- Linear ring
- Polygon
- Multi point
- Multi line string
- Multi polygon
- Geometry collection

===Input and output
These geometries can be input and output in WKB/EWKB format (as well as the related HexWKB and HexEWKB formats). Since EWKB and HexEWKB are respectively the canonical binary and ASCII representations of geometries in PostGIS, this functionality can prove useful. Geometries can also be output as WKT/EWKT.

===Installation
Just type :
      gem install GeoRuby

===License
GeoRuby is released under the MIT license.

===Support
Any questions, enhancement proposals, bug notifications or corrections can be sent to mailto:guilhem.vellut+georuby@gmail.com.
