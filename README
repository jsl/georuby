=GeoRuby
This is GeoRuby 0.1.1. It is intended as a holder for data returned from PostGIS and the Spatial Extensions of MySql. The data model roughly follows the OGC "Simple Features for SQL" specification (see http://www.opengis.org/docs/99-049.pdf), although without any kind of advanced functionalities (such as geometric operators or reprojections). 

===Available data types
The following geometric data types are provided :
- Point
- Line string
- Linear ring
- Polygon
- Multi point
- Multi line string
- Multi polygon
- Geometry collection

They can be in 2D, 3DZ, 3DM, and 4D.

===Input and output
These geometries can be input and output in WKB/EWKB/WKT/EWKT format (as well as the related HexWKB and HexEWKB formats). HexEWKB and EWKB are the default form under which geometric data is returned respectively from PostGIS and MySql.

===Installation
To install the latest version, just type :
      gem install GeoRuby

===Changes since the last version
- Addition of support for M and Z dimension in the data types, as well as in the EWKB and EWKT parsers.
- When creating a geometry, the presence of a Z or M dimension must be indicated. By default, the geometry is created in 2D and with a SRID of -1.
- Suppression of +as_binary+, +as_hex_binary+ and +as_text+. They have been replaced with +as_ewkb+, +as_wkb+, +as_hex_ewkb+, +as_hex_wkb+, +as_ewkt+ and +as_wkt+.
- Suppression of the static creation methods +from_raw_point_sequence+ (for some geometric types) and +from_raw_point_sequences+ (for other), to build a geometry from a list of point coordinates. They have been replaced by a +from_coordinates+ for all types.
- The static geometry construction method +from_hexewkb+ has been replaced with +from_hex_ewkb+.
